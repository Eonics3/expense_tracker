# Make it Count | Hacky Birthday MLH
# Inspiration
Recently, I've gone out to eat a lot, and have been spending more money with my friends. I wanted a way to see how much money I was spending and to keep a budget to make sure I don't go overboard in spending. Creating this app helped me see the different transactions I was making and how much money I had spent and earned in total.

## What it does
Allows users to track their finances by inputting the type, category, amount, and date that the transaction was made. The total expenses and income is displayed as well as a log of all the transactions the user has made.

## How we built it
Make it Count is created using the MaterialUI, and ReactJS framework along with React hooks, and Context API.

## Challenges we ran into
I've never used the Context API in React so using that to sync all the files together was difficult and time consuming.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I'm proud of being able to use different frameworks I wasn't extremely familiar with and creating new components with them.

## What we learned
I learned more about file organization as well as the power of that different frameworks bring compared to vanilla JS.

## What's next for Make it Count!
I'd like to implement a full front end and back end application that stores all of the users' data, and allows them to login to keep track of their data.

## Built With
css3, html5, javascript, react, chartjs
